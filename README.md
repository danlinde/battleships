battleships
===========

This was a Makers Academy teamwork exercise. 

Our team consisted of:
- [Daniel Linde](https://github.com/danlinde)
- [Jodie Parker](https://github.com/mindfulcoder)
- [Paulo Gaspar](https://github.com/paulogaspari)
- [Will Barnett](https://github.com/will118)

The task was to implement two Ruby classes (Board and Player) that could be used by an existing game server to play the game battleships.

Once we finished coding, we were able to play the game using [telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet). For more about the game of battleships see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game).
